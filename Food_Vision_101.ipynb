However, to do so GPU is needed though not all GPU are compatible for performing mixed precision. Knowing this, in order to use 'mixed precision training', we need access to a GPU which has a score of 7.0+.\n",

        "(**Mixed precision** is the use of both 16-bit and 32-bit floating-point types in a model during training to make it run faster and use less memory. By keeping certain parts of the model in the 32-bit types for numeric stability, the model will have a lower step time and train equally as well in terms of the evaluation metrics such as accuracy)\n",
