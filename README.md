# Food-Vision-101
Making Food Vision Big™, using all of the data from the Food101 dataset.

I am going to build Food Vision Big™, using all of the data from the Food101 dataset. All 75,750 training images and 25,250 testing images will be taken into consideration. This time I have got the goal of beating DeepFood, a 2016 paper which used a Convolutional Neural Network trained for 2-3 days to achieve 77.4% top-1 accuracy.
