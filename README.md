# Food-Vision-101üçîüëÅÔ∏è
Making Food Vision Big‚Ñ¢, using all of the data from the Food101 dataset.


## Problem Statement
Predict food image out of 101 category or classes of foods.

## Objective
I am going to build Food Vision Big‚Ñ¢, using all of the data from the Food101 dataset. All 75,750 training images and 25,250 testing images will be taken into consideration. This time I have got the goal of beating DeepFood, a 2016 paper which used a Convolutional Neural Network trained for 2-3 days to achieve 77.4% top-1 accuracy.

## Data
The original data came from the TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS), read the guide: https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/overview.
